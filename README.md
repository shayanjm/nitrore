# nitrore

A snappy NFA/DFA regex engine... or something

## Thoughts

+ RE => AST => NFA => DFA, test for regex inclusivity - store as labeled DFA and execute directly

+ AST => NFA by Thompson Construction

+ NFA => DFA by Rabin-Scott subset construction

+ Minimized DFA by Hopcroft

+ Assess inclusivity / isomorphism efficiently somehow

+ If inclusive, label appropriately and store labeled DFA
